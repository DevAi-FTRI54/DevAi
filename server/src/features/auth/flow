[1] User clicks “Login with GitHub” → OAuth flow
    |
    |—> backend exchanges code → gets access_token + GitHub identity
    |—> creates/updates user in DB
    |—> issues JWT to client
    |
[2] Frontend shows repo input (e.g. “https://github.com/user/repo-name”)
    |
    |—> backend checks if GitHub App is installed on that repo
          - if NOT: generate install link and redirect
          - if YES: continue
    |
[3] Backend uses GitHub App installation token
    |
    |—> authenticates as App
    |—> requests content of repo via GitHub REST or GraphQL API
    |
    |—> stores repo metadata / chunks for vector DB indexing
    |
[4] User enters question about repo → frontend hits RAG endpoint
    |
    |—> search vector DB → pass result + query to LLM
    |
    |<— returns answer (with citations if needed)
