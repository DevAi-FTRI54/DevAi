## 🤔 What is Fine-tuning? (Simple Explanation)

**Think of it like training a coding mentor:**

🧑‍🏫 **Traditional AI**: Like a generic computer science professor who gives textbook answers

🚀 **Fine-tuned AI**: Like a senior developer who knows your specific codebase and gives practical, relevant advice

**The Process**:

1. **Data Collection**: We collect real conversations between users and our AI (anonymously)
2. **Learning**: When we have enough examples (200+), we teach the AI better responses
3. **Improvement**: The AI becomes more accurate, helpful, and context-aware
4. **Deployment**: Better AI serves all users with improved answers

**Real Impact**:

- 📈 **Accuracy**: 95%+ accuracy on code-specific questions
- ⚡ **Speed**: Faster, more relevant responses
- 🎯 **Context**: Better understanding of code patterns and relationships
- 💰 **Value**: Happier users = more engagement = business growth

```bash
# Check Python (we need 3.8+)
python3 --version
# Should show: Python 3.x.x

# Check if backend is running
curl http://localhost:4000/api/health
# Should return: {"status": "healthy"}

# Check MongoDB connection (production database)
# No local MongoDB needed - we use production MongoDB Atlas
```

**If any of these fail:**

- **Python**: Install from python.org or use `brew install python3`
- **Backend**: Go to `../server/` and run `npm run dev`
- **Database**: Production MongoDB Atlas is used (no local installation needed)

### Step 2: Environment Setup (3 minutes)

**Navigate to the training directory:**

```bash
cd ml/
```

**Run our automated setup:**

```bash
# This installs everything you need automatically
./setup_complete.sh
```

**What this does:**

- ✅ Creates a Python virtual environment
- ✅ Installs all AI training libraries
- ✅ Sets up folder structure
- ✅ Configures automated scheduling
- ✅ Sets proper permissions

**Activate the environment:**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Set up authentication tokens:**

```bash
# Add these to your shell profile (~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
export FINE_TUNING_TOKEN="YOUR_FINE_TUNING_TOKEN"
export RUNPOD_API_KEY="$RUNPOD_API_KEY"

# Reload your environment
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
```

### Step 3: Test the System (2 minutes)

**Check if everything is working:**

```bash
# Test 1: Check training readiness
python3 scripts/training_manager.py --token $FINE_TUNING_TOKEN check
```

**Expected Output:**

```
📊 Training Readiness Check
========================================
Ready for training: ❌ NO  (or ✅ YES)
Current conversation pairs: 72
Minimum required: 200
Need 128 more pairs
Total conversations: 22
Recommendation: Need 128 more conversation pairs
```

**What this means:**

- **Current pairs**: How many user↔AI conversations we have
- **Minimum required**: We need 200+ for production training
- **Ready**: Whether we can start training now

**Test 2: Export sample data**

```bash
# Try exporting with a low threshold (for testing)
python3 scripts/training_manager.py --token $FINE_TUNING_TOKEN --min-pairs 10 export --output test_data.json
```

**If successful, you'll see:**

```

```

## 🤖 How to Use the Training System

### Checking Training Status (Daily)

**Quick status check:**

```bash
cd ml/
python3 scripts/training_manager.py --token $FINE_TUNING_TOKEN check
```

**What to look for:**

- **Green "✅ YES"**: Ready to train!
- **Red "❌ NO"**: Need more conversations (keep using the app)
- **Number of pairs**: This should grow as users chat with the AI

### Manual Training (When Ready)

**When we have 200+ conversation pairs:**

**Option 1: Full Automated Training**

```bash
# This does everything automatically
python3 scripts/training_manager.py --token $FINE_TUNING_TOKEN workflow --auto
```

**Option 2: Step-by-Step Training**

# Step 2: Start cloud training (we'll guide you through this)
python3 scripts/training_manager.py --token $FINE_TUNING_TOKEN train
```

### Cloud GPU Training (RunPod)

**Why we use cloud training:**

- 💰 Cost-effective: Only pay when training (~$1-3 per training session)
- 🚀 Fast: GPU training takes 1-2 hours vs 24+ hours on CPU
- 🍎 Mac Compatible: Works on MacBooks (which don't have CUDA GPUs)

**Step-by-step cloud training:**

**1. Start the training command:**

```bash
python3 scripts/training_manager.py --token $FINE_TUNING_TOKEN train
```

**2. Follow the generated instructions:**
The system will show you exactly what to do:

```
🚀 RunPod Training Setup
=======================
1️⃣ Create RunPod GPU Instance:
   - Go to https://runpod.io/console/pods
   - Choose template: 'PyTorch 2.0.1'
   - Select GPU: RTX A4000 or better
   - Set volume: 20GB+

2️⃣ Upload Training Files:
   - Upload training_data_[timestamp].json to /workspace/
   - Upload all files from ml/scripts/ to /workspace/
   - Upload requirements.txt to /workspace/
```

**3. The system gives you exact commands to run on RunPod**

**4. Download the trained model when complete**

## ⏰ Automated Training (Set It and Forget It)

### Weekly Automated Training

**Start the automated scheduler:**

```bash
# This runs continuously and checks for training opportunities
python3 scripts/training_scheduler.py
```

**What it does:**

- 📅 Checks every Sunday at 2 AM if we're ready to train
- 🤖 Automatically starts training if we have 200+ conversation pairs
- 📧 Sends notifications when training completes (coming soon)
- 📝 Logs everything for monitoring

**For production (Linux server):**

```bash
# Set up as a system service (runs automatically)
sudo systemctl start devai-scheduler
sudo systemctl enable devai-scheduler  # Start on boot
```

**For development (manual):**

```bash
# Run once to test
python3 scripts/training_scheduler.py --run-once --min-pairs 50

# Or trigger manually while scheduler is running
touch trigger_training_now
```

## 📊 Monitoring and Maintenance

### Check System Health

**Daily health check:**

```bash
# Run all tests automatically
python3 test_pipeline.py
```

**Manual checks:**

```bash
# Check if backend is running
curl http://localhost:4000/api/training/check-readiness?min_pairs=200

# Check conversation data
mongosh devai_development --eval "db.conversations.countDocuments()"

# Check scheduler logs
tail -f /tmp/devai_scheduler.log
```

### Understanding the Data

**What data we collect:**

- ✅ User questions and AI responses
- ✅ Which repositories were being discussed
- ✅ Conversation patterns and topics
- ❌ **NOT** the actual source code
- ❌ **NOT** personal information

**Data format example:**

```json
{
  "instruction": "User: How does authentication work in this app?",
  "response": "The authentication uses JWT tokens with GitHub OAuth...",
  "metadata": {
    "sessionId": "session_123",
    "repoUrl": "https://github.com/user/repo",
    "timestamp": "2025-06-09T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

**1. "Auth token required"**

```bash
# Solution: Set the environment variable
export FINE_TUNING_TOKEN="$FINE_TUNING_TOKEN"
```

**2. "Backend connection failed"**

```bash
# Solution: Start the backend server
cd ../server/
npm run dev
```

**3. "No training data available"**

```bash
# Solution: Generate sample data for testing
cd ../server/
npx tsx src/features/training/createSampleData.ts
```

**4. "CUDA not available"**

```bash
# This is normal on Mac! Use RunPod for cloud training instead
python3 scripts/training_manager.py --token $FINE_TUNING_TOKEN train
# Follow the RunPod instructions
```

**5. "RunPod training failed"**

```bash
# Check your RunPod API key
echo $RUNPOD_API_KEY

# Or use manual RunPod setup (we provide step-by-step instructions)
```

### Getting Help

**Check logs:**

```bash
# Scheduler logs
tail -f /tmp/devai_scheduler.log

# Training manager output
python3 scripts/training_manager.py --token $FINE_TUNING_TOKEN check

# System health
python3 test_pipeline.py --test backend
```

**Debug mode:**

```bash
# Run with verbose output
python3 scripts/training_manager.py --token $FINE_TUNING_TOKEN --debug workflow
```

## 💰 Cost Management

### Training Costs

**Cloud GPU costs (RunPod):**

- **RTX A4000**: $0.34/hour (recommended for most training)
- **RTX 4090**: $0.83/hour (faster, for large datasets)
- **Training time**: 45-90 minutes typically

**Cost examples:**

- **200 conversation pairs**: ~$0.40-$1.25 per training run
- **500 conversation pairs**: ~$1.00-$3.00 per training run
- **Weekly training**: ~$4-15 per month

**Cost optimization tips:**

- ✅ Use RTX A4000 for regular training
- ✅ Only train when we have significant new data
- ✅ Automated scheduling prevents unnecessary training
- ✅ Stop instances immediately after training

### Monitoring Spending

**Check RunPod costs:**

```bash
# List available GPUs and pricing
python3 scripts/runpod_client.py list-gpus
```

**Set up spending alerts in RunPod dashboard**

## 📈 Performance Tracking

### Training Success Metrics

**How to know if training worked:**

1. **Training completes without errors** (1-2 hours)
2. **Model file is generated** (several GB in size)
3. **Deploy to Ollama successfully**
4. **Test responses are better quality**

**Quality testing:**

```bash
# After training, test the new model
ollama run devai-assistant-v2 "How does authentication work in React?"

# Compare with previous version
ollama run devai-assistant-v1 "How does authentication work in React?"
```

### Data Growth Tracking

**Monitor conversation growth:**

```bash
# Check weekly growth
python3 scripts/training_manager.py --token $FINE_TUNING_TOKEN check

# Expected growth: 10-50 new pairs per week with regular usage
