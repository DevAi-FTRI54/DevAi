      "response": "The longest function in the `embeddingsController.ts` file is likely the one responsible for generating embeddings, which includes the logic for batching and creating a JSON file for batch processing. This function iterates through the `arrayOfChunks`, slices it into smaller batches, and constructs a JSONL file for OpenAI's API. The function handles both cases where the number of chunks exceeds a specified limit and where it does not, ensuring efficient processing of text embeddings. The detailed logic spans multiple lines, including the mapping of chunk objects to the required format for the API call.\n\nReferences:\n- embeddingsController.ts (lines 1-340): let batchEmbedding: Array<ChunkObject> = [];\nlet chunkSize = 20;\nlet startIndex = 0;\nif (arrayOfChun...",
